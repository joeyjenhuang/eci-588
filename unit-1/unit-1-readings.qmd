## OVERVIEW

The primary goal of the Unit 1 readings and discussion is to build a foundational understanding of text mining and its applications for understanding and improving teaching. The required and self-selected readings introduce text mining in educational contexts as well as text mining more broadly. A secondary goal of the readings and discussion is to help you begin generating ideas for independent analyses and your final course project.

## READINGS

To help address our discussion questions for the week, you will read or view **three resources**, including: **a required journal article, one instructor-selected resource, and one additional self-selected resource** (e.g., journal article, video, news article, podcast, or blog post).1. Required

### 3. Self-Selected Resource

Use the [NCSU Library](#0), [Google Scholar](#0) or a search engine of your choice to locate a journal article, presentation, website, or other scholarly resource. For example, in *Text Mining in Education* (Ferreira-Mello et al., 2019), one of the articles cited in the literature review may have piqued your interest and you may wish to follow up on it. Your selected resource should address one or more of the discussion topics or questions provided below. In addition, you are welcome to share less formal resources, such as videos or shorter online articles, that help the class better understand this week’s discussion topics.

## DISCUSSION

In lieu of the peer interaction and discussion of course materials that normally take place in class, you will engage with other members of our learning community through the course discussion forum. This week’s discussion consists of **four required discussion posts**.

**Posting Expectations (Required):** You are required to complete **ALL FOUR discussion posts** outlined below:

1.  **Three Topic Posts**

    -   You must post **one response to EACH of the three discussion topics** listed below (Topics 1–3).
    -   For each topic, respond to **one or more guiding questions** within that topic.
    -   Your responses should draw on:
        -   the required course reading,

        -   your instructor-selected resource, **and**

        -   your self-selected resource where relevant.

2.  **One Self-Selected Resource Post**

    -   You must post **one separate discussion post** introducing and summarizing your self-selected resource.
    -   This post should follow the **Student-Selected Resource guidelines** provided below.

3.  You do **not** need to respond to every question within a topic. Choose questions that allow you to contribute meaningfully and avoid repeating points already made by others.

### Guiding Questions

#### Topic 1: Text Mining Terminology

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What exactly is text mining?

2.  How is it defined or described in your readings?

3.  What alternative terms or phrases are used? How would you explain it to someone with no background in text mining?

4.  What are some other new terms, words, concepts that you have come across in the resources that were unfamiliar to you, or that you had come across before but feel you have a better understanding of after this week?

#### Topic 2: Methods, Techniques & Educational Applications

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What text mining methods or techniques are commonly used in analyzing text and for what purpose?

2.  How has text mining be applied to educational contexts, or in other fields that might be relevant to education?

3.  How might text mining be applied in your own professional context?

4.  How has/could text mining be applied to address systemic issues or persistent problems in Education?

#### Topic 3: Affordances, Limitations, & Ethical Issues

Reflecting on the course text and your self-selected reading, answer one or more of the following questions:

1.  What are some of the advantages of text mining over more traditional approaches to analyzing text as data?

2.  What are some of the challenges and limitations of text mining in comparison to traditional qualitative analysis?

3.  What ethical issues should be considered when mining text for educational purposes or in general?

#### Student-Selected Resources

Provide a brief overview of your self-selected resource that includes the following:

-   APA Citation (note: this can be easily [retrieved via Google Scholar](#0))
-   The purpose of the resource
-   How was Text Mining **defined** and/or characterized?
-   What **data source(s)** were analyzed or discussed?
-   How, if at all, did your article touch upon the **application(s)** of text mining to "understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?"
-   Did your selection address any **ethical or legal considerations** of text mining?

## ASSESSMENT

### Grading

Grading for this week is intentionally lenient, as long as it is clear from your posts that you have completed the required readings. Readings and discussion for each unit are worth **6 points** total and are evaluated based on three criteria: **quantity, quality, and connections to readings**.

**Quantity** (2 points): You are expected to contribute **at least four discussion posts** over the course of the week, spread across **at least two different days**. To help facilitate meaningful discussion, your initial post should be submitted by **Friday**.

Q**uality** (2 points): Your posts should offer new, thoughtful, or insightful contributions to the discussion questions or topics (see [Gao’s productive online discussion model](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&&context=vcte_pub&&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C34%2526q%253DGao%252Bproductive%252Bonline%252Bdiscussion%252Bmodel%2526btnG%253D#search=%22Gao%20productive%20online%20discussion%20model%22)summarized below). There is no required length for individual posts; in fact, short conversational exchanges (approximately 1–3 paragraphs) are strongly encouraged.

**Connections to readings (2 points):** Across your posts, you should help interpret or extend the discussion by explicitly connecting ideas to the course readings or other shared resources. Following Gao’s *Disposition 1: Discussion to Comprehend*, your contributions should make clear connections to **at least three different resources** over the course of the week.

### Productive Online Discussion Model

#### Disposition 1: Discuss to Comprehend

Actively engage in such cognitive processes as interpretation, elaboration, **making connections to** prior knowledge.

-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to the **learning materials**
-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to **personal experience**
-   Interpreting or elaborating the ideas by making connection to other **ideas, sources, or references**

#### Disposition 2: Discuss to Critique

Carefully **examine other people's views**, and be sensitive and analytical to conflicting views.

-   Building or **adding new insights or ideas** to others' posts
-   **Challenging ideas** in the texts
-   Challenging ideas **in others' posts**

#### Disposition 3: Discuss to Construct Knowledge

Actively **negotiate meanings**, and be ready to reconsider, refine and sometimes revise their thinking.

-   **Comparing views** from the texts or others' posts
-   Facilitating thinking and discussions by **raising questions**
-   Refining and **revising one's own view** based on the texts or others' posts

#### Disposition 4: Discuss to Share Improved Understanding

Actively **synthesize knowledge** and explicitly express improved understanding based on a review of previous discussions.

-   **Summarizing personal learning** experiences of online discussions
-   **Synthesizing content** of discussion
-   **Generating new topics** based on a review of previous discussions
